# Basic 2D wave propagation in C with python for I/O

Naive wave propagation in C. 
Python is used to perform I/O operations.
The modeling function in C sould be recompiled into a shared library named "libpropagation.so" after each change.

Simply type command "python propagation.py" to see the propagation result on a artificial model
